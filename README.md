## What's This All About? 🤔

Ever found yourself drowning in a sea of browser tabs? Bookmarks looking like a digital hoarder's paradise? Enter Vyajan - your personal link sanctuary where URLs come to chill and stay organized!

## Features That'll Make You Go "Wow!" 🎉

### 🌟 Smart Organization
- **All Links**: Where every URL is a VIP
- **Important**: For those extra special links you can't live without
- **Archive**: Where links go for a peaceful retirement
- **Inbox**: Your link's first stop in their organizational journey

### 🎨 Cool Stuff We've Got
- 🎥 Automatic YouTube thumbnail previews (because who doesn't love pictures?)
- 📝 Automagic metadata fetching (we read the boring stuff so you don't have to)
- 🔄 Swipe actions that make organizing feel like a game
- 🌐 Universal link support (if it's on the internet, we can handle it!)
- 🎯 Google Sign-In (because remembering passwords is so 2010)

## Getting Started 🚀

1. Clone this bad boy:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anima-regem/vyajan.git
```

2. Get those dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Run it like you mean it:
```bash
flutter run
```

## Why "Vyajan"? 🤓

Because "Yet Another Link Manager" was too boring! Plus, we wanted something that sounds cool at parties.

## Contributing 🤝

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request (and cross your fingers! 🤞)
